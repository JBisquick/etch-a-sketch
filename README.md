# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

DOM was utilized to alter the number of pixels on the etch-a-sketch. Changing the color of etch-a-sketch pixels was achieved by using events. Functions and events were utilized to alter the different coloring options for the etch-a-sketch.

# Lesson's Learned:

I gained a deeper understanding of how to build loops, DOM, and events. I learned how to write code that is cleaner and has shorter functions.
